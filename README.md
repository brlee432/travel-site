# travel-site
This is a travel site I built a while ago to explore more modern facets of web development. It was created using ES6 syntax, 
webpack, automated sprites, automatic browser-refreshing, and the BEM philosophy in combination with a generally modular approach.
This was one of my more recent projects and is hosted on github pages.
